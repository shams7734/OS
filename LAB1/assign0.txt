Assignment 0 Program 1 : In this program the address of a variable is different each time and if we enter in a long loop then
                         the the address of the variable is the same for the complete loop.But if we perform this on different 
                         OS the address is different but in long loop the value of address is same.I have written a program for 
			 that named assign0.c   .



Assignment 0 Program 2 : In this we have to run the top command It displays the CPU %, memory taken by processes and other details
			 of the processes.It takes memory6.5 % and CPU 2.7 %.If a browser(firefox) is opened the CPU takes 6.3 % space 
                         and memory 7.0 % and it continuously goes on changing. firefox is taking most of the CPU and msot of the 
			 memory share and it changes every sec.
