---   This is the code generate my own shell. 

---   It supports commands as like ls , pwd ,clear ,gedit, sleep,cd ,exit, Ctrl +d,etc.

---   It supports '&' command also to work or function in background.

---   In this first we take input from the user and then that input is parsed and is broken into tokens wherever " " is found .
      And then that command is fork then if process id <0 then chid process can not be forked and if > 0 then parent process  
      goes in wait state and waits.

---   It also handles gracefully .

---   The code of this is named as 'assign2.c'.

---   I have written the code for pipe also.
