Ans 1)-
	(a) The dependencies are resolved by giving the dependent filename before the `:` and source after it. 
    
	(b) $< the first prerequisite (usually the source file).

	     
	    $@ is the name of the file being generated,

	    
	    $^ is the names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.


		e.g: all: library.cpp main.cpp
		
		In this case:

		    $@ evaluates to all
		    $< evaluates to library.cpp
		    $^ evaluates to library.cpp main.cpp


	(c) Give names to the files like makefile.win and makefile.nix and use them:


                make -f makefile.win
		make -f makefile.nix

		or have a Makefile that contains:

		win:
		  make -f makefile.win

		nix:
		  make -f makefile.nix

		and use make win or make nix


    (d) Dependency is make.h and make.c
