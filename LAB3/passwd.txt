Ans 3)
	(a) The output is : -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 54256 Mar 29  2016 /usr/bin/passwd
	    
	    root owns this file.


	(b)  The file owner is 'root' and the SUID permission is set (the '4')â€”so the file is executed as 'root'.

	     The reason the executable is run as 'root' is so that it can modify files that the user would 
	     not normally be allowed to, without giving user full root access. A default use of this can be seen 
	     with the /usr/bin/passwd binary file. passwd needs to modify /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow which store 
	     account information and password hashes for all users and can only be modified by 'root'.
