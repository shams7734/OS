Ans 2)

	(a) 
	    fork.c :
	    
		 Location : linux-4.9.5/kernel/fork.c
 
 		 Command : find . -name fork.c
		 

	    sys_fork() :

		 Location : linux-4.9.5$/arch/m68k/kernel/entry.S

		 Command :  grep -r sys_fork


	    do_fork() :  
	    
		 Location: linux-4.9.5/kernel/fork.c

		 Command : grep -r do_fork

	(b) Location : linux-4.9.5/include/linux/sched.h
	
	    Command : grep -r ^'struct task_struct' include/

  		It contains all the information that the kernel has about a process. Each task_struct data structures
	        describes a process or task in the system. 
		Each element in the task list is a process descriptor of the type struct task_struct, which is defined 
		in <linux/sched.h>. The process descriptor contains all the information about a specific process.

	(c) Command to list all make files: tree -I "makefile"

	
	(d) Location of jiffies: jiffies.c is located at /linux-4.9.5/kernel/time/jiffies.c
				 jiffies.h is located at /linux-4.9.5/include/linux/jiffies.h


	    In operating systems, especially Unix, a jiffy is the time between two successive clock ticks. 
	    Historically, this has been 10ms. A jiffy in Linux can have various values.

	    OR we can say that

	    The global variable jiffies holds the number of ticks that have occurred since the system booted. 
	    On boot, the kernel initializes the variable to zero, and it is incremented by one during each timer 
	    interrupt. Thus, because there are HZ timer interrupts in a second, there are HZ jiffies in a second. 
	    The system uptime is therefore jiffies/HZ seconds.
